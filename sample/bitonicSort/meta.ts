    "A naive bitonic sort algorithm executed on the GPU, based on tgfrerer's implementation at poniesandlight.co.uk/reflect/bitonic_merge_sort/. Each dispatch of the bitonic sort shader dispatches a workgroup containing elements/2 invocations. The GUI's Execution Information folder contains information about the sort's current state. The visualizer displays the sort's results as colored cells sorted from brightest to darkest.",
