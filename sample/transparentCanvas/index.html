    <h1>WebGPU</h1>
    <p>WebGPU exposes an API for performing operations, such as rendering
    and computation, on a Graphics Processing Unit.

    <p>Graphics Processing Units, or GPUs for short, have been essential
    in enabling rich rendering and computational applications in personal
    computing. WebGPU is an API that exposes the capabilities of GPU
    hardware for the Web. The API is designed from the ground up to
    efficiently map to (post-2014) native GPU APIs. WebGPU is not related
    to WebGL and does not explicitly target OpenGL ES.

    <p>WebGPU sees physical GPU hardware as GPUAdapters. It provides a
    connection to an adapter via GPUDevice, which manages resources, and
    the device's GPUQueues, which execute commands. GPUDevice may have
    its own memory with high-speed access to the processing units.
    GPUBuffer and GPUTexture are the physical resources backed by GPU
    memory. GPUCommandBuffer and GPURenderBundle are containers for
    user-recorded commands. GPUShaderModule contains shader code. The
    other resources, such as GPUSampler or GPUBindGroup, configure the
    way physical resources are used by the GPU.

    <p>GPUs execute commands encoded in GPUCommandBuffers by feeding data
    through a pipeline, which is a mix of fixed-function and programmable
    stages. Programmable stages execute shaders, which are special
    programs designed to run on GPU hardware. Most of the state of a
    pipeline is defined by a GPURenderPipeline or a GPUComputePipeline
    object. The state not included in these pipeline objects is set
    during encoding with commands, such as beginRenderPass() or
    setBlendConstant().`
